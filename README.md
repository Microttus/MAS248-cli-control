# MAS248-cli-control
This project aims to show how the MAS248 Robotics project at the University of Agder can be solved purely without the use of ROS by taking advantage of the UR_RTDE driver for python control of an Unv√≠versial Robots Arm and other python libearies such as cv2 and matplotlib

Comand to launch:

```shell
python ur5 _run_trajectory <ip> --traj <path_file> --z-offset 0.015 --ext-urcap --urcap-port 50001 -v -v
```
